Long-term insulin resistance puts a burden on the pancreas. Then it is considered that sustained hyperglycemia, urinary sugar, and other typical situations of diabetes occur due to a subsequent decrease in insulin secretion or glucose toxicity (onset of insulin resistance due to sustained hyperglycemia).\n Symptoms: As an early symptom, increased drinking and urination are often observed. Weight loss gradually becomes noticeable as long as there is a state of hyperglycemia. Decreased appetite is rather rare until it becomes severe. Also, if hyperglycemia continues, it may lead to a state called ketoacidosis. When ketoacidosis occurs, decreased appetite, loss of energy, vomiting, etc. are observed. Furthermore, the symptoms progress to a life-threatening condition such as being unable to get up and being in a daze (or losing consciousness), a decrease in blood pressure and shock status.\n Prevention of diabetes: In cats, obesity is often involved in the onset of diabetes.

However, in cats, temporary hyperglycemia due to stress can also occur, so if the condition is stable and not in an emergency state such as excessive hyperglycemia or currently in ketoacidosis, we may start treatment or response to factors that may cause insulin resistance, such as stress or infection, and confirm the sustained high blood sugar and urine sugar levels before making a definitive diagnosis of diabetes.\n Treatment for diabetes: Depending on the cause of onset of diabetes, we first start controlling blood sugar levels with appropriate treatment from a home doctor. However, if the patient\u2019s condition has worsened at the time of visit and is severe, we prioritize emergency treatment by judging that they have already developed ketoacidosis.\n Treatment for regulating blood sugar levels generally involves insulin hormone injections to supplement the treatment and therapeutic diets to control rapid increases in blood sugar levels. In addition, necessary measures are taken in parallel for factors that may be related to insulin resistance, such as obesity, infections, and inflammation.\n In some cases in cats, insulin secretion ability may remain in the pancreas, and in such cases, oral glucose-lowering agents or dietary therapy may be effective.

Symptoms such as weight loss despite eating, poor coat condition, and aggressive behavior may also be observed. As the disease progresses, appetite and activity levels may decrease, and it can put a strain on the heart and various organs.\n Prevention of hyperthyroidism: Prevention is difficult as the trigger for the disease is often unknown.

However, surgical treatment may not be possible if there are underlying diseases other than the thyroid, and since the condition of hyperthyroidism may already be putting a significant burden on the body, it is common to start with internal medicine treatment to adjust the body\u2019s condition and further consider the treatment plan in the future. When symptoms that suggest hyperthyroidism are observed, thyroid hormone measurements are performed for diagnosis in addition to regular tests, and treatment begins with internal medicine treatment and dietary management based on the measured values. After that, the progress is monitored by regularly performing blood tests and hormone measurements to judge the effectiveness of the treatment and changes in the cat\u2019s condition. If stable health is observed, an examination is performed to carefully determine whether surgery is possible, taking into account the cat\u2019s age, overall condition, and risks of general anesthesia."

If your cat is not feeling well and has symptoms such as diarrhea, take it to the vet. Also, since your cat is only 5 months old, it may be due to the following reasons if it is still energetic. Cats grow rapidly until about 6 months of age and then continue to grow slowly until about 12 months of age. They require a lot of calories until about 6 months of age, but the necessary calories decrease slightly after that, so a decrease in appetite may be observed around that time. Even if your cat has been eating vigorously until now, it may seem to have a poor appetite or anorexia. Additionally, cats change their teeth from milk teeth to permanent teeth after 4 months, and some cats may temporarily lose their appetite due to discomfort in their mouths during this process.

Try giving your cat various types of water if they are particular about it. Some cats prefer fresh cold water, while others prefer lukewarm water like stagnant water, bottled water, or filtered water. If possible, try different types of water1. Also, how about the container you put the water in? Some cats stop eating and drinking when their whiskers touch the dish. One way to solve this is to change the dish to a wide one that does not touch the edge of the dish. Some cats are particular about the material of the container, such as plastic, pottery, and stainless steel. It may be a good idea to try changing the material of the container. Please also check if the container is placed in an easy-to-drink location for your cat. If the toilet is nearby or there is an air freshener nearby, the smell may be a concern and your cat may not approach the container. Some cats prefer running water over water in a container.

Also, it\u2019s effective to leave some food for your cat before you go to bed. If you give your cat food every time he wakes up, it will become a habit, so it\u2019s better to ignore him when he comes to wake you up. If you want your cat to sleep as much as possible at night, it\u2019s a good idea to increase playtime during the day and tire him out.

Additionally, since your cat is already 17 years old, changing their habits may be challenging.\n One method that is not too burdensome for both the cat and the owner is to switch to wet food. Dry food typically contains only 5-10% moisture, while wet food contains 75-80%, so eating wet food can significantly increase their water intake.\n If your cat has become less active with age and has stopped drinking water, try placing water bowls in various locations. If water is easily accessible from anywhere, your cat may drink more frequently. Also, pay attention to the shape and amount of water in the bowl. Cats may find it difficult to drink from shallow bowls or deep bowls with only a small amount of water. Providing a larger bowl with plenty of water may make it easier for them to drink."

Some cats don\u2019t like changes in their food, so it\u2019s best to choose food that suits your cat\u2019s preferences and lifestyle as much as possible. For example, if your cat already prefers wet food, it\u2019s best to continue giving them wet food. If your cat tends to graze throughout the day, dry food may be easier to provide.

        "output": "Octopus, squid, shrimp, and other seafood contain a substance called thiaminase. If you consume a lot of this thiaminase, it breaks down the vitamin B1 in your body, which can lead to symptoms of vitamin B1 deficiency.\n The initial symptoms of vitamin B1 deficiency are loss of appetite and nausea. As the disease progresses, neurological symptoms such as dilated pupils and unsteady gait may occur.\n For this reason, it is said that cats should not be fed a lot of seafood. Thiaminase is heat-sensitive and will break down if heated. Therefore, if the seafood is boiled, cats will not develop vitamin B1 deficiency even if they eat it. However, even if boiled, octopus, squid, and shrimp may cause poor digestion, diarrhea, or vomiting. When giving it to your cat, give it in small amounts."

The main symptoms of onion toxicity are vomiting, diarrhea, and a type of anemia called Heinz body anemia, which can cause the cat\u2019s urine to turn red and the mucous membranes to turn white. In this case, since the cat only ate one piece of croquette with onions, the likelihood of toxicity symptoms is low. However, the toxic dose can vary depending on the individual cat, and some cats have developed toxicity symptoms from just licking onion soup. Additionally, anemia symptoms may not appear until 1-3 days after ingestion, so it is important to observe the cat for signs of anemia for a few days."

        "output": "Cats are natural hunters, and this instinct appears even in kittens. it\u2019s possible that your kitten got carried away and ate the toy made of rabbit leather. Since leather is difficult to digest, it can become a foreign object and cause problems. If your kitten has only chewed and swallowed a small amount, it may pass through the stool, but if she has swallowed it whole or in large quantities, it can cause intestinal obstruction and require immediate attention. Since your kitten is only 4 months old, her intestines are thinner and less developed than those of adult cats, making the risk even higher. Please take her to your regular animal hospital immediately. If there is any remaining part of the toy, bring it with you. This type of ingestion is common in young cats up to about 3 years old. it\u2019s similar to how infants who can\u2019t judge what they can eat often put things in their mouths. There have been cases where young cats have undergone surgery for intestinal obstruction and a toy mouse has been found.

The only female cat stopped using the litter box properly when she turned 2 years old. (Both big and small...) It was around the time we welcomed the fourth cat. Even if we increased the number of litter boxes (one per cat) or used automatic litter boxes, it didn\u2019t work because the other cats used them.

Next, if you have identified which cat is the problem, have your regular veterinarian check for any underlying illnesses or pain that may be present. Indoor cats are generally prone to urinary stones, cystitis, and elimination problems due to obesity. If there is a physical problem, increasing the number of litter boxes or trying to train the cat will not solve the problem. If no problems are found in the previous steps, the next step is to review the litter box environment and communication among the cats. In a multi-cat household, it is not uncommon for certain cats to be incompatible with each other. Alternatively, it is not uncommon for a cat to feel stressed by the noise and commotion caused by frequent fights between other cats. If this female cat is confirmed to be the cat that is eliminating in inappropriate places, what is the interaction between her and the four male cats like? It is necessary to carefully review the relationship between the cats, such as if they completely ignore each other, bully each other, or chase each other. If it is determined that the environment in which the female cat can live comfortably is not in place, especially when the owner is absent, it may be one option to prepare a female cat-only food bowl, bed, litter box, and territory and keep her in a separate room from the male cats during the day to make her feel safe."

The most common external factor is that one or both cats are startled or frightened by something and take it out on each other. Unfortunately, if this state continues for a long time, the relationship between the cats will inevitably deteriorate. Therefore, the first thing to do is to separate the two cats and let them live peacefully and calm each cat down. Once both cats have calmed down, try giving them each other\u2019s favorite food in a separated space, such as a door or cage, to create a new impression of each other (to forget old memories as much as possible). If you continue this step patiently, there is a high possibility that the impression of the other cat will gradually return to a favorable one. However, even if you reconcile them, there is a possibility that the same kind of trigger will cause them to fight again.

Is it always the same person who gets bitten? Are you petting the cat just before he bites? Or is it when the cat is sitting on your lap? If you repeat the same pattern even when you get bitten, the cat will unconsciously repeat the same behavior, so it\u2019s important to change the pattern. Take the time to prevent it in advance, such as not petting the cat in the same way even if he\u2019s rolling around, or not touching the same part of his body that he bit before.\n Next, if he bites your ankles, he may be targeting moving targets. In other words, you need to present a moving target other than your ankles. Use a cat teaser, a toy shaped like a mouse, or even an app for cat games on an iPad. By enriching your cat\u2019s living environment with these things, you can help prevent biting. Finally, scolding your cat after he bites is the least effective method. If you are too late to take action, your cat, like a dog, will not learn, and will instead learn to defend himself aggressively, as mentioned here. While it\u2019s okay to say \"ouch\" or \"that hurts\" instinctively, never scold your cat for biting.

If you see them scratching elsewhere, don\u2019t scold them, but take them to the \"scratching board\" and teach them by holding their front legs. They will learn to use the board, which has the scent of their own feet. Also, kittens in the same behavior range often learn the materials used by their mother for scratching and use the same ones.

In the past, methods such as placing food bowls in the urine-marked area, placing something that scares the cat, such as a mousetrap, or punishing the cat by spraying water or mist when it tries to spray urine have been used.

Sweet peas are legumes and contain a substance called amino propionitrile, which can cause nerve paralysis and affect walking if eaten. Please be careful to prevent your cat from eating them. By the way, plants in the lily family are known to be very dangerous for cats. The entire plant contains toxins that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and severe kidney failure even if only a small amount is ingested, and can lead to death.

If a toxic amount of tobacco has been ingested, symptoms such as excitement, tremors, vomiting, and diarrhea can appear within 10 minutes to an hour.\n While it is unlikely for a cat to eat an entire cigarette, it can be dangerous for them to lick nicotine-laced water from ashtrays containing many cigarette butts. Nicotine can also be absorbed through the skin.\n If you are unsure if your cat has eaten tobacco, it is especially dangerous for small cats or kittens.

Wool sucking is often seen in cats that were weaned early, and in such cats, it seems to be a type of \"baby regression\" behavior that recalls the mother cat\u2019s nipples. When a cat finds a cloth with a texture it likes, it may exhibit this behavior or when it wants affection. What you need to be careful about with wool sucking is that there is a risk of it getting stuck in the intestines by biting or eating cloth of a certain size. In such cases, surgery may be required to remove it. Since it is difficult to completely stop wool sucking, make sure to hide items that your cat may chew or try to eat in a place where they cannot reach, such as a drawer"

Some foods can even cause poisoning in cats, even if they are harmless to humans. Therefore, it is not recommended to give human food to cats. No matter how much they want human food, it is important to be firm and not give it to them. Also, since your cat makes a fuss during human meals, you should put your cat in another room or a cage covered with a towel during human meals, and let it spend time there without showing it what humans are eating, and ignore it when it meows.

However, after being spayed, female cats may appear more affectionate to their owners as they are no longer spending time in heat. Prior to being spayed, female cats frequently cycle in and out of heat, so their energy is often focused on mating. Once they are spayed, they may be able to relax and focus more attention on their human companions.\n On the other hand, after being neutered, male cats may behave less aggressively and spray less. However, overall cat personality is still mainly a product of genetics and upbringing."

Carrying around extra fat can put felines in danger of developing chronic health conditions. Fortunately, it can be easy to tell if your cat is overweight. When looking down on them from above, overweight cats lack a discernible waist. From the side, an overweight cat\u2019s belly is closer to the ground than [it is to] the chest. Another sign that your cat is too plump is if you cannot feel their last few ribs by lightly running your hands over their sides."

People who are allergic to cats are not actually allergic to their fur, but to a protein in their saliva, skin, and urine. That protein is transferred to the fur when a cat grooms itself. Fluffier breeds tend to shed more, spreading that protein-laden fur around and making them more likely to trigger an allergy attack in sufferers. However, there are some cat breeds that produce fewer allergens than others. Some low-shedding cat breeds include Siberian, Russian Blue, Bengal, and Burmese cats. You can also consider getting a cat that doesn\u2019t shed much or even a hairless cat like a Sphynx."
