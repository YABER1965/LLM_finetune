Some cats may be allergic to the ficus and develop skin rashes or breathing problems. If your cat ingests any part of the ficus, you should contact your veterinarian immediately."}
{"question": "Are cats less domesticated than dogs? Are cats becoming more domesticated over time?", "answer": "Cats are far more similar to their wild ancestors than dogs are to wolves, so dogs are in that sense the more domesticated of the two species. As they adapted to living alongside humans, cats became more sociable with one another and much more accepting of people, but there is no evidence that they have changed much more than that over the past few thousand years."}
{"question": "Will cats, which require meat, eventually evolve to eat a broader array of foods as dogs do?", "answer": "Cats are more strictly carnivorous than dogs, because they have lost some genes that allow them to make certain nutrients from plants. Dogs have more copies of a gene that helps them digest starch. Cats would have to evolve new traits to eat a broader array of foods, which is unlikely given their long evolutionary history."}
{"question": "How do they purr?", "answer": "The purr is an unusual vocalization, made by rattling the vocal cords together rather than vibrating them by pushing air past them, which is how cats—and humans—generate all their other vocal sounds. That's why cats can purr when they're breathing in and breathing out. Most species of wildcats can purr, including the cheetah. The exceptions are the big cats—lion, tiger, jaguar and leopard—whose voice boxes are modified so that they can roar."}
{"question": "Why do house cats have so many vocalizations compared with wildcats?", "answer": "House cats have more vocalizations than wildcats because they use them to communicate with humans. They learn that meowing can get our attention and express their needs. Some breeds, like Siamese, are more chatty than others. Wildcats don't need to meow as much because they rely on other cues to interact with each other. Big cats can roar but not purr, while house cats can purr but not roar."}
{"question": "Do cats think of their owners as parents? Siblings? Friends?", "answer": "By rubbing around our legs when they greet us, cats show that they regard us as friendly but at the same time slightly superior to them. When living in a family group, kittens rub on their mothers, females rub on males and smaller cats rub on bigger cats. The reverse rarely occurs—an indicator of the small imbalance of power in each of these relationships."}
{"question": "How can you get a cat to love you?", "answer": "Cats naturally feel affection for those who feed, look after and play with them, although they don't always make that obvious. Trust can be harder to win because some cats are just nervous. One trick is to always allow the cat to approach you rather than forcing yourself on the cat when you feel like it. When the cat does approach, reward it with a few treats and let it leave as soon as it wants to. You should find that it comes to you a little sooner, and stays for a little longer, each time."}
{"question": "Why do cats sometimes suddenly bite or scratch the person who is petting them?", "answer": "You have probably missed the warning signs that the cat has had enough. Some cats, even if they enjoy being petted, also tire of it very quickly. Flattened ears and a slight twitching of the tail can signal that they have had their fill. If you have such a cat, try breaking off from stroking it every few seconds and allow it to move away if it wants to."}
{"question": "Can cats get jealous?", "answer": "Research has demonstrated that dogs can get jealous, so cats probably can, too. For both species jealousy is an in-the-moment emotion they experience when they see that another individual is getting the attention they are craving: they don't remember being jealous once the moment has passed. As with dogs, cats have a limited concept of time: they can learn to distinguish between different time intervals but only when these intervals are limited to a few seconds. Thinking back into the more distant past is probably beyond their abilities."}
{"question": "Do cats remember different people or just the people they see on a daily basis?", "answer": "Scientists have not studied this specific trait directly, but cats do seem to forget other cats once they have been separated for a long time, so the same probably applies to people as well. Dogs, for whom humans are much more important, can remember people by their scent for months, probably years."}
{"question": "Do coat colors and patterns correspond to certain personality traits in cats?", "answer": "There's no scientific proof that coat color affects cat personality, but some breeds do have distinct traits. These may be influenced by genes or hybridization with wildcats."}
{"question": "Why do cats sometimes suddenly decide to run around like crazy for no apparent reason?", "answer": "Cats can get quite frustrated if they are bored or if they are stressed, perhaps because they have just seen a rival cat through the window. Under such circumstances, the slightest movement, perhaps just a speck of dust caught in a shaft of light, can set them off. Regular play sessions can help dissipate all that energy and relieve any stress."}
{"question": "Why do cats love to climb into boxes, including ones that seem too small?", "answer": "Cats like to feel well protected, especially when they intend to sleep, and cardboard cartons can be ideal for a secure nap. Why some seem to prefer too small boxes over just right ones is a mystery, though."}
{"question": "Why do cats climb to heights that they are subsequently afraid to jump down from?", "answer": "Cats climb to heights because they can use their claws to go up, but not down. Some cats may get scared or go too high. They can fall safely by spreading their legs and skin like a parachute, and landing on their feet."}
{"question": "Why do some cats go crazy for catnip and others show no response at all?", "answer": "Catnip contains a chemical that mimics a cat's pheromones, which can trigger different behaviors in cats that have a gene for it. About two thirds of cats have this gene, while the rest are unaffected by catnip. The catnip response is not related to any other aspects of a cat's personality or health. It is just a random genetic trait."}
{"question": "Why do cats lick and chew plastic bags, power cords and other nonfood items?", "answer": "Veterinarians have noted an unhealthy taste for plastics in some cats but have never convincingly explained it. Cats may be trying to alleviate stress. Among oriental cat breeds, adults commonly suck, chew and eat fabrics, especially wool, in response to stress. Also, kittens of all kinds that are weaned too early may develop the habit of suckling on a blanket, usually purring and kneading with their front paws at the same time, as if the blanket were their mother."}
{"question": "Why do they chew their fur?", "answer": "There are two possible reasons for this behavior. One is itchy skin, possibly caused by fleas or other parasites, or an allergy. But persistent overgrooming on one spot or pulling out clumps of fur can also be signs of chronic stress, perhaps because of conflict with another cat in the house or in the neighborhood."}
{"question": "Why do cat feet sometimes smell like tortilla chips?", "answer": "A common minor fungal skin infection, similar to athlete's foot in humans, often produces this smell. Dogs may carry this fungus, too."}
{"question": "Why are cats so finicky about food and their litter boxes? Why are they so sensitive to any change in routine?", "answer": "Cats are picky about food because they need specific nutrients. They are also slow eaters and like to bury their waste. Cats dislike change because they are attached to their territory."}

{"question": "Are cats really drawn to people who are allergic to them?", "answer": "Cats cannot sniff out people who are allergic to them. If cats are paying extra attention to someone with allergies, it's likely because they are responding to that person's body language. People with allergies tend to ignore or avoid the cat in the room, which reduces the feline's fear of an unfamiliar person. Cats are most likely to be drawn to someone who gives them their space and allows them to approach the human first."}
{"question": "Is it possible to give a cat too much catnip?", "answer": "Not every cat reacts to catnip the same way. Some cats seem to lose control when they are around catnip. However, the plant isn't harmful to or addictive for cats . If your cat is attracted to the scent, there is no harm in letting them enjoy it for training or playtime . But keep in mind that your cat might begin to feel nauseous or become irritated if you give them too much of it."}
{"question": "Can you actually train your cat to use a toilet?", "answer": "It is possible to train a cat to use a toilet. However, the drawbacks may outweigh the benefits of being able to flush your cat's waste away. A change in urine production is often the first sign of a serious medical condition, and if the cat is using the toilet as opposed to the litter box, this is more likely to be missed. It's also worth noting that if a family member accidentally leaves the toilet lid down, closes the bathroom door, or is occupying the bathroom, the cat may have accidents around the house."}
{"question": "Can cats tell if someone is pregnant?", "answer": "According to Dr. Gary Richter, a veterinarian and author of 'The Ultimate Pet Health Guide,' cats have an incredible sense of smell and are great at reading body language. During pregnancy, women experience profound changes in their hormone levels which can affect their personal scent, so cats can understand that something is changing based on the new smell. However, cats are not furry pregnancy tests and cannot tell if someone is pregnant .\n It is also worth noting that a person's body temperature often rises in the first trimester of pregnancy. So if you notice a cat snuggling up to someone who is pregnant, they might just be enjoying the extra body heat."}
{"question": "Are male cats friendlier than female cats?", "answer": "There is no clear difference between male and female cats in terms of their friendliness and affectionate nature. Although male cats have a reputation for being more companionable than female cats, it totally depends on the cat."}
{"question": "Is it OK to only feed your cat dry food?", "answer": "Dry cat food is often easier to dispense and cheaper to buy than wet food. However, it may not be the best idea to put your pet on a dry-food-only diet. Wet cat foods are generally higher in protein and are always higher in moisture than dry foods, which more closely matches feline nutritional needs.\n Cats can actually avoid chronic dehydration by having wet food in their diet. Chronic dehydration too often leads to tooth decay, bladder stones, and urinary tract infections. Many health issues can be prevented simply by adding a daily meal of wet food to your cat's diet.\n If you still insist on feeding your cat only dry food, give it to them in several small, measured meals throughout the day rather than leaving a bowl of it out at all times."}
{"question": "Will getting a cat spayed change how friendly it is?", "answer": "Spaying a female cat does not alter its personality. However, after being spayed, female cats may appear more affectionate to their owners as they are no longer spending time in heat. Prior to being spayed, female cats frequently cycle in and out of heat, so their energy is often focused on mating. Once they are spayed, they may be able to relax and focus more attention on their human companions.\n On the other hand, after being neutered, male cats may behave less aggressively and spray less. However, overall cat personality is still mainly a product of genetics and upbringing."}
{"question": "How can you tell if your cat is overweight?", "answer": "If you're concerned that your cat might be overweight, it's best to consult with your veterinarian to put them on a special diet. Carrying around extra fat can put felines in danger of developing chronic health conditions. Fortunately, it can be easy to tell if your cat is overweight. When looking down on them from above, overweight cats lack a discernible waist. From the side, an overweight cat's belly is closer to the ground than [it is to] the chest. Another sign that your cat is too plump is if you cannot feel their last few ribs by lightly running your hands over their sides."}
{"question": "Is one litter box per cat not enough?", "answer": "Each cat should ideally have two litter boxes. If your cat is prone to having accidents around the house, they may just need an additional litter box. Placing another litter box in the right spot could solve the problem."}
{"question": "Is 'Free-feeding' your cat healthy?", "answer": "'Free-feeding' your cat by leaving out un-portioned food for them to graze on throughout the day is not a healthy practice. It increases the likelihood of your cat becoming overweight. Instead, it is recommended that you measure your cat's food and give them the appropriate amount. If you're worried about not being able to feed your cat on schedule, you can invest in an automatic feeder to ensure that your cat isn't left with a growling belly or an unhealthily pudgy one."}
{"question": "Is there no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic cat?", "answer": "There are no cat breeds that are completely hypoallergenic. People who are allergic to cats are not actually allergic to their fur, but to a protein in their saliva, skin, and urine. That protein is transferred to the fur when a cat grooms itself. Fluffier breeds tend to shed more, spreading that protein-laden fur around and making them more likely to trigger an allergy attack in sufferers. However, there are some cat breeds that produce fewer allergens than others. Some low-shedding cat breeds include Siberian, Russian Blue, Bengal, and Burmese cats. You can also consider getting a cat that doesn't shed much or even a hairless cat like a Sphynx."}
{"question": "Is it normal or healthy for cats to cough up hairballs?", "answer": "Cats coughing up hairballs is not a healthy or normal behavior. It could be a sign that the cat has either swallowed too much hair through over-grooming or that their digestive system isn't correctly processing the small amount of hair that they do typically swallow. There are special diets and supplements that you can give to help decrease hairballs. Brushing your cat daily will also help decrease the amount of hair they take in while grooming. If you notice your cat struggling with hairballs, talk to your vet to help identify the problem before radically changing your cat's diet or giving them medicine."}
{"question": "Can indoor cats get fleas and ticks?", "answer": "Cats can get fleas and ticks even if they do not go outside. Your dog can bring fleas and ticks inside and give them to your cat. Because of this, be sure to also keep your cat on flea and tick medication. Therefore, it is recommended that you speak to your vet about getting your cat on flea and tick medication and regularly check all of your pets for parasites.\n There are various flea and tick medications available for cats, such as topical ointments, oral tablets, and flea collars. You may want to consult with your vet to determine which medication is best suited for your cat's needs."}
{"question": "Do cats and dogs have different needs?", "answer": "Cats and dogs have different needs, including different diets. Cats have many different requirements than dogs, and they need a different type of diet than dogs. For example, cats sleep much more than dogs . If you're used to caring for dogs, it's especially important to read up on proper cat care and consult with a vet to make sure you're meeting all your feline's individual needs ."}
{"question": "All cats hate people and they are not cuddly animals. Is it true?", "answer": "The myth that all cats hate people and are not cuddly animals is not true. Although not all cats love cuddles and attention, there are many cats that do. Cats can be very cuddly and they also typically require a lot of love. This myth is perpetuated because we are looking at cats through dog-colored glasses. Many people compare the behavior of cats to the behavior of dogs, which may lead them to think cats aren't cuddly creatures. Cats are snuggly but in their own way. They don't bark or cry at you or beg for your attention the way dogs do."}
{"question": "Cats are low-maintenance pets that don't require much care. Is it true?", "answer": "Cats require a certain regimen of care from their owners, and they are not high maintenance but they do have maintenance. In certain ways, dogs may require a bit more attention than cats but that doesn't mean cats don't need love and care.\n Having the mentality that cats are low-maintenance can be dangerous. One of the things as being a real problem is that many clients who think it's OK to go out of town for a few days and leave their cat with an automatic feeder and some water because they're 'low-maintenance.' Well, they're not. They get separation anxiety, just like dogs do. They crave the stability of their family life, just like dogs do. They just don't show it the way dogs do."}
{"question": "Cats always land on their feet when they fall. Is it true?", "answer": "Cats have a built-in balancing system called the 'righting reflex' that helps them orient themselves to land on their feet. Additionally, cats have a vestibular apparatus inside their ear that is used for balance and orientation. This enables cats to quickly figure out which way is up and rotate their head immediately so their bodies can follow . However, this reflex and the special apparatus aren't always effective, especially if a cat is falling from a high place."}
{"question": "Cats are supposed to drink cow's milk. Is it true?", "answer": "Many cats are attracted to dairy products, but some types of milk are not safe for them to ingest. Cow's milk is not specifically recommended because it can be harmful and cause lactose intolerance and other symptoms like an upset stomach if given too much. Instead, giving cats water or wet food to is recommended to hydrate them."}
{"question": "It's always best for cats to live outdoors. Is it true?", "answer": "When you have a cat as a pet, you typically have two options — raise them to be indoor cats by not allowing them to go outside or raise them as outdoor cats, giving them the option of going outside whenever they'd like. Some people believe that cats, even domesticated ones, are meant to live in the great outdoors but it really depends on the cat, noting that he personally believes it is better if they are kept inside.\n An outdoor-only cat has an average lifespan of two to five years. The average lifespan of an indoor only cat is around 14 years.\n Therefore, it is not always best for cats to live outdoors. It depends on the cat and its environment."}
{"question": "Cats absolutely hate water. Is it true?", "answer": "Some cats love to play with water. Many cats are actually fascinated by water and some even love to play with it, especially if it is running from a faucet. In reality, cats just generally don't like to be submerged in water."}
{"question": "Cats and dogs are mortal enemies. Is it true?", "answer": "Cats and dogs are not always mortal enemies, and it is possible for them to get along or at least tolerate each other. He explained that there is a communication gap between the two species, which is why it's our job to be ambassadors and do everything we can to ease that communication gap."}
{"question": "Keeping a cat as a pet can be dangerous for pregnant people. Is it true?", "answer": "The myth that keeping a cat as a pet can be dangerous for pregnant people is false. However, pregnant people should be cautious when handling kitty litter and cat feces due to the risk of toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by a common parasite that can be transmitted through exposure to infected cat feces. Pregnant people should avoid changing a cat's litter box and instead give that responsibility to someone else."}
{"question": "You can't train a cat. Is it true?", "answer": "Cats can be trained, but it differs from training a dog because cats will not learn from discipline and will run away from any type of punishment. Short training sessions with a clicker and rewarding your cat is recommended for small lessons learned. Over time, you can replace the clicker sound by saying 'good' and they will associate it with a reward."}
{"question": "Cats are nocturnal creatures. Is it true?", "answer": "Cats are not nocturnal creatures. They are crepuscular animals and are most awake at dusk and dawn. This makes sense when you think about the fact that their natural prey is awake at dusk and dawn, i.e. the bugs, critters, crickets, and the like."}
{"question": "Declawing a cat is quite harmless. Is it true?", "answer": "Declawing your cat is not a harmless way to stop them from scratching your furniture. The procedure can have lasting psychological and physical implications for cats as they go on in life. Many countries and a few cities in the US have already banned this practice. Instead of removing the claws entirely, you can trim them if they are too sharp. In some cases, cats will even groom themselves by trimming their own claws using their teeth."}
{"question": "Indoor cats don't need as many shots as outdoor cats. Is it true?", "answer": "It is important to have routine vaccines and dewormers for cats and kittens, regardless of whether they will be indoor only or indoor and outdoor. One of the most important shots for kittens up to 16 weeks is FVRCP (which stands for Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis/Calicivirus/Panleukopenia), which is considered a core vaccination for all cats. Therefore, it is recommended that indoor cats receive the same vaccinations as outdoor cats."}
{"question": "Indoor cats can't really get sick. Is it true?", "answer": "It is true that outdoor cats are generally more prone to contracting certain diseases because they can sometimes attack dangerous, infected prey or fight with stray cats. However, indoor cats are not immune to all illnesses. Indoor cats face diseases such as obesity, dental disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, cancer, and arthritis. Keeping your cat indoors will help reduce their risk of contracting parasites since they will not be preying on any small animals like birds. It is recommended that you routinely take your cat to your local veterinarian to ensure they are in good health."}
{"question": "Cats can see perfectly in total darkness. Is it true?", "answer": "Cats can't see perfectly in total darkness. They can only see in the dark if they have the slightest bit of light. Their eyes gather that light in and they intensify that light in the back of their eye in a membrane called tapetum. A cat's eyes are designed to help them hunt prey in low-light atmospheres. They do their best work not in total darkness, but pretty close."}
