{"question": "What is the reason behind cats' kneading behavior?", "answer": "Cats knead to show happiness, stimulate milk production, and make a comfortable nest."}
{"question": "Why do cats like boxes?", "answer": "Finding a tight space to hide out is an instinctual behavior in cats, both wild and domestic. This can help them gain an advantage over their prey, where they can watch them unseen. Boxes also provide mental enrichment and, like you might have guessed, another place to nap."}
{"question": "Why do cats have whiskers?", "answer": "Whiskers are sensitive organs that help a cat (and many other animals) navigate tight crawl spaces, avoid harm to the eyes, and detect subtle changes in the wind in order to discern movement from prey."}
{"question": "Why are cats afraid of water?", "answer": "Some cats, both in the wild and certain breeds like Maine Coons, seem to be unperturbed by water. However, it's thought that cats avoid water because it weighs them down when they're wet. Therefore, it's more difficult for them to escape quickly or catch prey."}
{"question": "Why do cats purr?", "answer": "Cats purr due to vibration of vocal cords caused by neurological stimulation from brain activity. The purpose of purring is uncertain, but it does seem to be associated with pleasurable activity. Cats are also known to purr when ill or injured, which leads some to believe that the frequency of the vibration can be associated with greater healing. Purring is also reinforcing for people and therefore can increase the amount of petting. Cats generally purr when in contact with someone; a favored owner stroking, nursing a kitten, or greeting a familiar partner-cat. Positive experiences also elicit purring, rolling or rubbing, being in a warm familiar environment or about to fall peacefully asleep."}
{"question": "How long do cats live?", "answer": "The average lifespan of a cat is around 15 years. However, this can vary depending on the health of the cat, nutrition, and preventive care. Cats can live up to 22 years. Outdoor cats often live shorter lives than indoor cats. Being overweight or obese shortens life by 1 to 2.5 years on average. Regular health care, physical examinations, parasite prevention, and vaccinations provide protection against threats to life and health1. House cats can expect to live 15 to 20 years, with some reaching 25. Advances in preventing kitten-hood diseases such as distemper and feline leukemia, heartworms, and other parasites are key in extending longevity, along with better diets. Indoor cats face fewer threats from predators and trauma but are also facing an obesity epidemic leading to skyrocketing rates of diabetes."}
{"question": "Why do cats sleep so much?", "answer": "Cats sleep an average of 16 to 18 hours a day. One reason is energy conservation. Cats use a special form of sugar to fuel their short bursts of activity. It takes a while to restore this energy so cats are careful when and why they rush into action. Cats are most active at dawn and dusk, so to balance their instinct and our human schedules, they end up taking lots of “cat naps.” Often they appear to be asleep but are instantly awakened; this type of sleep varies with another deeper one. They tend to sleep in short increments of 10 to 30 minutes, so they are probably not sleeping as much as we think."}
{"question": "What does catnip do to cats?", "answer": "Catnip is an herb that is known to stimulate cats. About half of cats are genetically likely to respond to the active oil in catnip. It is not certain what part of the brain is stimulated by this ingredient, but it is not harmful and can be used to help increase the use of items like scratching posts. Many treats have this to help stimulate play. The aroma of catnip in cats is thought to be quite pleasurable. It has no other significance and seems to be a genetic accident. It is an autosomal dominant trait, so not all cats are sensitive."}
{"question": "Should I brush my pet's teeth?", "answer": "Yes, you should brush your pet's teeth regularly using pet toothbrushes and pet toothpaste. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, 80% of dogs develop signs of teeth and gum diseases after reaching the age of 3. Cats also face the risk of developing dental disease, with Periodontal disease being the most common. To combat this, veterinarians recommend yearly professional cleanings and daily brushing by pet owners. Proactive, preventative care can prevent serious effects of dental problems and promote overall good health."}
{"question": "Why can't cats roam around outside?", "answer": "Cats are known for their love of exploration and adventure. However, outdoor spaces pose several hazards to cats, which can threaten their safety, health, and the environment. These hazards include cars, wild animals, toxins/poisons, diseases, parasites, and upsetting native wildlife and ecosystems. To keep your cat safe while still allowing them to enjoy the outdoors, you can consider creating a secure outdoor space for them to explore, such as a screened-in patio or porch or a sunroom. Alternatively, you can leash train your cat and take them for walks or use an animal stroller equipped with a secure, see-through covering that lets your cat safely interact with the outside world."}
{"question": "Why do cats bring their kills to their humans?", "answer": "Cats do not bring their kills to their humans as presents. Instead, they take their kills somewhere safe before they eat them. If this location happens to be in or near the kitchen, they are automatically reminded that commercial cat food is much tastier than mouse, and hence they abandon their catch then and there."}
{"question": "Why do they knock objects off tables and shelves?", "answer": "Cats knock objects off tables and shelves for various reasons. Some cats are just clumsier than others, and material possessions mean nothing to them. Others will bat items over the edge simply to get their owner's attention. Sometimes they seem to do it for their own entertainment or because they have learned that this is a game that their owner seems to enjoy."}
